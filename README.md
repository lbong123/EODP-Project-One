# EODP-Project-One

Here is a small project I did for a course in uni - Elements of Data Processing 

# Project Description
It should be no surprise to us that while news sources provide most of the information we learn every day, it is questionable whether the news we read is
credible and trustworthy. Differentiating legitimate and correct news articles
from ‘fake’ or misleading ones is an important task, raising the interest of journalists, policy makers and researchers in many fields such as social science and
data science. Specifically in the context of health, the consequences of delivering
illegitimate news can be paramount and irreversible.
In this assignment, you will be working on a dataset comprising more than
1,000 health-related news articles, the reviews of these articles, and tweets about
the new articles.
Using this dataset, you will have an opportunity to learn how to identify
‘good’ and ‘bad’ news by characterising some linguistic patterns of news, as
well as comparing different news outlets based on their correctness of reporting.

# Learning Outcomes

• Practice text processing techniques using Python.
• Practice data processing, exploration and visualisation techniques with
Python.
• Practice visual analysis and written communication skills.
• Be able to read and write data in different formats, and combine different
data sources.
